# Movie_search_app

Welcome to the Movie Search App, a simple web application created for practice purposes. This app allows you to search for movies by their name and retrieves detailed 
information about the movie from an open-source API. If a movie is not available in the API, it will display a "Movie Not Found" message. Additionally, while the app is
fetching movie details from the server, it displays a loading spinner to keep users informed of the search progress.

Features
Search by Movie Name: Users can enter the name of a movie they want to search for, and the app will query the API for information related to that movie.

Detailed Movie Information: Once a movie is found in the API, the app provides detailed information about the movie, including its title, release year, genre, plot summary, 
and more.

Error Handling: If the app cannot find a movie based on the user's search, it gracefully handles the situation by displaying a "Movie Not Found" message.

Loading Spinner: While the app is retrieving data from the API, it displays a loading spinner to give users visual feedback that the search is in progress.
